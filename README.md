<p style="border-bottom: 3px solid lightgrey;"></p>

Cognitive Search Workshop is a new enrichment pipeline that allows you to find rich structured information from documents. This one day training will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency on Cognitive Search, an AI-orietend product announced on [Microsoft Build 2018](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/build). These labs assume an inroductory to intermediate knowledge of [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/), [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and [Azure Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/). If this is not your case,  we have quick start materials in the pre-requisites section of this training.

##**Goals**

At the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

+ Understand what Cognitive Search is
+ Configure your Cognitive Search service
+ Implement Azure Search features to provide a positive search experience inside applications
+ Configure an Azure Search service to extend your data to enable Cognitive Search
+ Build a solution that enrich, index and search for cognitive data

Cognitive search is a new enrichment pipeline that allows you to find rich structured information from documents. This enriched information can become part of your Azure Search index. If you are already familiar with Azure Search concepts and workflows, these tips can help you get started:
+ Learn the key concepts: [Cognitive search (preview)](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md)
+ Step through a short tutorial. Start with service provisioning (Basic or above) in **West Central US** and continue with tasks essential to the workflow: [Get started with cognitive search preview](cognitive-search-get-start-preview.md)
+ Step through a longer, guided example to learn a few things about extensibility. We anticipate that custom enrichment is a primary scenario for most customers. Hopefully this example makes your investigation go a little smoother: [Example on creating a custom skill using the Text Translate API](cognitive-search-create-custom-skill-example.md)
