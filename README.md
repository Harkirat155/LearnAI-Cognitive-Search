This workshop leads you through a series of labs that explain what Cognitive Search is, the related Microsoft Technologies and how to create a solution to analyse unstructred data like photos, presentations, pdf and text. For the full list, see [Supported formats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage#supported-document-formats).
The code of this workshop is public and sample data is provided, but you can use or own, making this training a great tool for POCs or demos. The solution can be deployed on Azure, leveraging cognitive and data services.

The material of this workshop is intended for professionals basically familiar with Azure Portal and Visual Studio C# development: Architects, Data Scientists, Developers. [If any of these topics are new to you, we have a learning path here that you can follow to bring you up to speed before you start this workshop](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/training/learning-paths/).

## Getting Started
Cognitive search is a new enrichment pipeline that allows you to find rich structured information from documents. This enriched information can become part of your Azure Search index. If you are already familiar with Azure Search concepts and workflows, these tips can help you get started:
+ Learn the key concepts: [Cognitive search (preview)](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md)
+ Step through a short tutorial. Start with service provisioning (Basic or above) in **West Central US** and continue with tasks essential to the workflow: [Get started with cognitive search preview](cognitive-search-get-start-preview.md)
+ Step through a longer, guided example to learn a few things about extensibility. We anticipate that custom enrichment is a primary scenario for most customers. Hopefully this example makes your investigation go a little smoother: [Example on creating a custom skill using the Text Translate API](cognitive-search-create-custom-skill-example.md)
