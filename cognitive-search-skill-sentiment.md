#	Microsoft.Skills.Text.Sentiment cognitive skill

The sentiment skill evaluates unstructured text, and for each record, returns a numeric score between 0 and 1. Scores close to 1 indicate positive sentiment, and scores close to 0 indicate negative sentiment.

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.SentimentSkill

## Data Limits
The maximum size of a record should be 5000 characters as measured by String.Length. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the sentiment analyzer, you may use the Pagination Skill.


## Skill Parameters
